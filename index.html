                <p>Augmented Empathy is a 4 week online participation programme, part of 
                    <a href="http://fact.co.uk/thelivingplanet" target="_blank">#TheLivingPlanet</a>
                     a free online programme that explores our relationship 
                    with the natural world FACT, Liverpool. In a time of climate emergency 
                    and COVID-19 we will together explore  how we need to rethink how we 
                    identify and connect with ourselves, each other, animals and the Earth. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each week, Keiken will produce a prototype augmented reality filter 
                    for anyone to try. Participants will be invited to roleplay in a series 
                    of challenges which will augment themselves into post-human, non-human, 
                    animal and collective beings. These sensory challenges will ask the 
                    participants to discuss and deconstruct how these identity changes made 
                    them feel and ask them what they experienced. The challenges and responses 
                    will be reflecting on how we learn, unlearn and deconstruct what we identify 
                    as “self” to have a wider, more fluid understanding and empathy towards 
                    humanity and the earth. We will be looking at how technology can be used 
                    as an empathy tool and provoking questions and thoughts around speculative 
                    futures. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Participant responses will be recorded and contribute to the final outcome 
                    of the programme, 3 final filters published on the FACT instagram and 
                    performance later in the year.
